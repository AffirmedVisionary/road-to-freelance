# Road To Freelance

A companion repository to my third #100DaysOfCode challenge

## Objectives:

- [ ] Create a diary for the challenge which other challenge goers can use in the future.
- [ ] Collect a list of resources for freelance web development as I go.
- [ ] Create an ongoing future project wishlist.

## Desirables:

- [ ] Maintain github streak throughout the 100 days.
- [ ] Create 5-10 blog posts from diary entries.
- [ ] Screen record one process and host the video somewhere.
- [ ] Set up my personal slack to recieve project updates.
